# Payments

Payments are at the core of Invoiced. Invoiced handles your online payments as well as giving you tools to track offline payments.

Online payments let your customers directly pay invoices through Invoiced. If a customer pays online we will automatically record the payment. We currently support credit/debit cards, [ACH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_Clearing_House), [bitcoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin), and PayPal.

Offline payments represent transactions that happen outside of Invoiced, like a wire transfer for example. You can track offline payments regardless of the payment instrument used. 

Unlike online payments, offline payments must be recorded in the dashboard once received.
