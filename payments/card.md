# Credit Card Payments

Accepting credit and debit cards is currently the quickest and easiest way to get paid online.

## Prerequisites

You must have an account with a payment processor that supports one of these [payment gateways](gateways). If you do not see your gateway listed then please contact us at [support@invoiced.com](mailto:support@invoiced.com) to discuss getting it added.

## Setup

Once you are established with a payment processor, setting up credit card payments is easy! Follow these steps to start accepting credit card payments in minutes.

1. From the Invoiced dashboard go to **Settings** > **Payments**.

3. Select your payment gateway and follow the on-screen instructions to connect your payment gateway.

## Client Workflow

Paying with credit or debit card is fairly straightforward for customers. When a customer is viewing a payment form they would select **Credit Card** as the payment method. Then they will enter in their card information and click pay. We will give them a receipt immediately following a successful payment.

## Virtual Terminal

Like customers, internal Invoiced users have the ability to apply a payment to an account with a credit card payment on an invoice. Whether a customer has saved a credit card payment method on file or has provided the user with the information, easily access the virtual terminal for payments by navigating to the invoice and selecting receive payment -> charge. From there, you can select the saved credit card or enter a new card for use.

## AutoPay

Credit card payments work with [AutoPay](/docs/payments/autopay) when your customer saves their card as a payment source.
