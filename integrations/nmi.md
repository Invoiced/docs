1. From the Invoiced dashboard go to **Settings** &rarr; **Payments**.

2. Click **Setup** on the payment method you want to accept.

3. Click **Connect Payment Gateway**.

4. Select **NMI** as the payment gateway.

5. Enter in your NMI **Username** / **Password** and click **Save**. Then click **Enable** and the payment method you selected should be enabled.

## Client Workflow

### Credit Cards

Paying with credit or debit card is fairly straightforward for customers. They simply enter in their cardholder information and click **Pay**. We give receipts to your customers after a successful payment.

### ACH

Customers can pay with ACH just as easily as with credit cards. The key difference is that ACH payments will take several business days to clear. When customers are on a payment form they will select ACH as the payment information and then enter in their bank account and routing number.
