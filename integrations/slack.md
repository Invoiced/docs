# Slack Integration

With our Slack integration you can receive real-time notifications when important billing events occur. The Slack integration can notify you when a new customer is added or an invoice is paid.

## Setup

You can follow these instructions in order to set up the Slack integration on Invoiced.

1. Go to **Settings** &rarr; **Integrations** in the Invoiced dashboard.
