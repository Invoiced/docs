# Single Sign-On

With Single Sign-On (SSO) customers can seamlessly sign into your billing portal from your app or website.

Our SSO feature lets you securely generate URLs to sign customers into your [billing portal](/docs/guides/billing-portal). This is perfect for redirecting users already authenticated within your app or service into your billing portal without the need for them to sign in once more.

## Generating SSO URLs

1. Obtain your SSO key from the dashboard
   
   You can grab the secret key for generating SSO URLs for your account in **Settings** > **Developers** > **Single Sign-On** within the dashboard.

   **WARNING**: Keep your SSO key secret! It should only be used on servers under your control and never exposed in client-side code.

2. Generate an SSO URL

   Using your SSO key you can now generate [JWT tokens](https://jwt.io) from your backend that tell us which customer to sign in. The steps to generate a JWT token will vary by language, however, there are many open source libraries that make it a simple process.

   Any JWT tokens you generate should be signed using the `HS256` algorithm with your SSO key. The token should have the following parameters for the header:

   ```bash
   {
   	 "alg": "HS256",
   	 "typ": "JWT"
   }
   ```

   And the following parameters for the payload:

   ```bash
   {
   	 "sub": "{invoiced_customer_id}",
   	 "iss": "Ruby Backend",
   	 "exp": 1455564948
   }
   ```

   The `sub` parameter should be the ID of the customer on Invoiced you are signing the user in as. The `iss` parameter should be a string to identify the service that generated the token (any value works here). The `exp` parameter should be a [UNIX timestamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) to indicate when the URL should expire.

   This will generate a token similar to this:

   `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwiaXNzIjoiUnVieSBCYWNrZW5kIiwiZXhwIjoxNDU1NTY0OTQ4fQ.LXu-zcMTF8ikMSRrSVYnP0szyRZuqQOAorHAsDrfwPs`

   We recommend taking a look at [jwt.io](https://jwt.io) to verify that tokens you generate are valid and to find client libraries in your language.

3. Build the SSO URL

   Now you can plug your freshly generated token into an SSO URL (replace `yourcompany` with your Invoiced username):

   `https://{yourcompany}.invoiced.com/login/{generated_token}`

   You can now link your freshly generated SSO URL from your website or else redirect users here.

## Example

Here is an example showing how to generate an SSO URL in Ruby with the `jwt` gem:

```ruby
require 'jwt'

sso_key = '{sso_key_from_dashboard}'

exp = Time.now + 86400 # link expires in 1 day

payload = {
	:sub => 1234, # invoiced customer ID
	:iss => "Ruby Backend",
	:exp => exp.to_i
}

token = JWT.encode payload, sso_key, 'HS256'

url = "https://yourcompany.invoiced.com/login/#{token}"
