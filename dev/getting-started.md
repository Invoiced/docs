# Developing on Invoiced

At the heart of Invoiced is a powerful billing API. It allows you to build integrations with accounting systems, CRMs, ordering systems, business intelligence, and any other backoffice systems used to run your business.

The API was modeled after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">REST</a>. All communication happens over HTTPS with `https://api.invoiced.com`.

## Getting Started

The first step is to determine how you want to connect to the API. We offer client libraries in several languages, including <a href="https://github.com/Invoiced/invoiced-ruby">Ruby</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Invoiced/invoiced-php">PHP</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Invoiced/invoiced-python">Python</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/Invoiced/invoiced-go">Go</a>. If we don't have a client library for your language then we would be happy to build one. Otherwise you can manually build the HTTP requests, which is not too difficult.

Once you have your client library ready to go the next step is to get an API key. The API uses [Basic Authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication) to authenticate requests. All API requests require a valid API key. You can grab an API key by signing in to the dashboard, and then going to **Settings** > **Developers** > **API Keys**. Please remember to keep this API key safe. In the wrong hands it could give unwanted access to your Invoiced account.

Next, we are going to walk through a common invoicing workflow.

### Choose your language

<div class="language-selector">
	<a href="#" class="btn btn-link" data-lang="bash">Shell</a>
	<a href="#" class="btn btn-link" data-lang="ruby">Ruby</a>
	<a href="#" class="btn btn-link" data-lang="php">PHP</a>
  <a href="#" class="btn btn-link" data-lang="python">Python</a>
</div>

### Creating a Customer

Customers are at the core of everything on Invoiced. Customers represent a billable entity from your perspective, whether this is a person, organization, or account. You must create a customer first before you can invoice or accept payments.

Every customer has an AutoPay [AutoPay](autopay) option. When enabled this will charge your customer's connected payment source each billing cycle. When AutoPay is off (the default) we will instead issue an invoice that your customer can pay using any of the payment methods you accept.

```bash
curl "https://api.invoiced.com/customers" \
  -u {API_KEY}: \
  -d name="Acme" \
  -d email="billing@acmecorp.com" \
  -d number="1234" \
  -d payment_terms="NET 30"
```

```ruby
require "invoiced"
invoiced = Invoiced::Client.new("{YOUR_API_KEY}")

customer = invoiced.Customer.create(
  :name => "Acme",
  :email => "billing@acmecorp.com",
  :number => "1234",
  :payment_terms => "NET 30"
)
```

```php
$invoiced = new Invoiced\Client("{YOUR_API_KEY}");

$customer = $invoiced->Customer->create([
  'name' => "Acme",
  'email' => "billing@acmecorp.com",
  'number' => "1234",
  'payment_terms' => "NET 30"
]);
```

```python
import invoiced
client = invoiced.Client("{YOUR_API_KEY}")

customer = client.Customer.create(
  name="Acme",
  email="billing@acmecorp.com",
  number="1234",
  payment_terms="NET 30"
)
```

The `number` property helps you tie the customer on Invoiced to the ID already used within your system. It is not required as we would generate a value for you if it was not supplied.

We highly recommend saving the customer's Invoiced `id` in your own database. This ID is required to retrieve the customer's account, create invoices, and perform any other customer-centric tasks.

### Creating an Invoice

Invoices are another core resource on Invoiced. As you would expect, an invoice represents an amount owed to you by a customer.

```bash
curl "https://api.invoiced.com/invoices" \
  -u {API_KEY}: \
  -d customer={CUSTOMER_ID} \
  -d items[0][name]="Copy paper, Case" \
  -d items[0][quantity]=3 \
  -d items[0][unit_cost]=45 \
  -d items[1][name]="Delivery" \
  -d items[1][quantity]=1 \
  -d items[1][unit_cost]=10 \
  -d taxes[0][amount]=3.85
```

```ruby
invoice = invoiced.Invoice.create(
  :customer => customer.id,
  :items => [
    {
      :name => "Copy paper, Case",
      :quantity => 3,
      :unit_cost => 45
    },
    {
      :name => "Delivery",
      :quantity => 1,
      :unit_cost => 10
    }
  ],
  :taxes => [
    {
      :amount => 3.85
    }
  ]
)
```

```php
$invoice = $invoiced->Invoice->create([
  'customer' => $customer->id,
  'items' => [
    [
      'name' => "Copy paper, Case",
      'quantity' => 3,
      'unit_cost' => 45
    ],
    [
      'name' => "Delivery",
      'quantity' => 1,
      'unit_cost' => 10
    ]
  ],
  'taxes' => [
    [
      'amount' => 3.85
    ]
  ]
]);
```

```python
invoice = client.Invoice.create(
  customer=customer.id,
  items=[
    {
      'name': "Copy paper, Case",
      'quantity': 3,
      'unit_cost': 45
    },
    {
      'name': "Delivery",
      'quantity': 1,
      'unit_cost': 10
    }
  ],
  taxes=[
    {
      'amount': 3.85
    }
  ]
)
```

The invoice will inherit the AutoPay and payment term settings from the customer's profile.

#### Sending Invoices

Now that you have created the invoice you might want to send it to the customer. That's fairly easy to do through the API.

```bash
curl "https://api.invoiced.com/invoices/{INVOICE_ID}/emails" \
  -u {API_KEY}: \
  -X POST
```

```ruby
invoice.send
```

```php
$invoice->send();
```

```python
invoice.send
```

The customer will be sent the invoice with a **View Invoice** button using the default email template. You can customize these templates through the dashboard in **Settings** > **Emails**.

#### Catalog Items

Our Catalog feature allows you to build a simpler, more robust integration by centralizing pricing information for the products and services that you sell. You must first add catalog items through the dashboard in **Settings** > **Catalog** or through the catalog items API. Then you can bill for catalog items by simply referencing them by ID:

```bash
curl "https://api.invoiced.com/invoices" \
  -u {API_KEY}: \
  -d customer={CUSTOMER_ID} \
  -d items[0][catalog_item]="copy_paper_20lb" \
  -d items[0][quantity]=3 \
  -d items[1][catalog_item]="delivery" \
  -d taxes[0][amount]=3.85
```

```ruby
invoiced.Invoice.create(
  :customer => customer.id,
  :items => [
    {
      :catalog_item => "copy_paper_20lb",
      :quantity => 3
    },
    {
      :catalog_item => "delivery"
    }
  ],
  :taxes => [
    {
      :amount => 3.85
    }
  ]
)

```

```php
$invoice = $invoiced->Invoice->create([
  'customer' => $customer->id,
  'items' => [
    [
      'catalog_item' => 'copy_paper_20lb',
      'quantity' => 3
    ],
    [
      'catalog_item' => "delivery"
    ]
  ],
  'taxes' => [
    [
      'amount' => 3.85
    ]
  ]
]);
```

```python
invoice = client.Invoice.create(
  customer=customer.id,
  items=[
    {
      'catalog_item': "copy_paper_20lb",
      'quantity': 3
    },
    {
      'catalog_item': "delivery"
    }
  ],
  taxes=[
    {
      'amount': 3.85
    }
  ]
)
```

Note that we did not have to include the `unit_cost` on the item as it was filled in automatically (although you can override per line item by including it). Another benefit of catalog items is that it helps tie together line items together in reports.


### Recording a Payment

On Invoiced payments are represent with the **Transaction** resource. A transaction models the exchange of value between you and a customer, including payments, refunds, and credits. Whenever customers pay online through the billing portal we automatically create a transaction for the payment. However, if you accept payments outside of Invoiced, always true if you are accepting checks or wire transfers, then you have to record the payment yourself through the dashboard or API.

```bash
curl "https://api.invoiced.com/transactions" \
  -u {API_KEY}: \
  -d invoice={INVOICE_ID} \
  -d method="check" \
  -d gateway_id="1450" \
  -d amount=148.85
```

```ruby
invoiced.Transaction.create(
  :invoice => invoice.id,
  :method => "check",
  :gateway_id => "1450",
  :amount => 148.85
)
```

```php
$invoiced->Transaction->create([
  'invoice' => $invoice->id,
  'method' => "check",
  'gateway_id' => "1450",
  'amount' => 148.85
]);
```

```python
client.Transaction->create(
  invoice=invoice.id,
  method="check",
  gateway_id="1450",
  amount=148.85
)
```

This will record a payment for the invoice we created earlier and mark it as paid. Since this is an offline payment the `gateway_id` property can be used to reference a check #. And that's it for a basic accounts receivable workflow.
