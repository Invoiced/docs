# Customizing Templates

Invoiced ships with default templates for invoices, statements, and receipts, however, it's possible these templates do not match your business or branding needs. In this guide we will show you how to change the layout and appearance of the default templates.

The underlying templates are HTML and CSS. Both the layout and styling can be customized. The first step is to head over to **Settings** > **Appearance** > **Layout**. Then turn on the switch next to **Use Custom Layout**.

[![Customizable Invoice Templates](../img/customizable-invoice-templates.png)](../img/customizable-invoice-templates.png)

[Mustache](https://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html) is the templating language used to power templates on Invoiced, including the HTML for custom templates.

### Testing

We recommend using the [Try Mustache](http://trymustache.com/) tool to verify your Mustache HTML for correct syntax. After saving any changes you can download a PDF preview by clicking the **Preview** button near the top right of the page. You can also see the generated HTML on a live invoice that has your customizations applied by opening the client view and appending `/html` to the URL, i.e. `https://dundermifflin.invoiced.com/invoices/IZmXbVOPyvfD3GPBmyd6FwXX/html`.
