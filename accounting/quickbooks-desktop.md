## Edge Cases

Here we have documented all of the limitations, nuances, and edge cases to be aware of when using the QuickBooks Desktop integration.

- Customers on Invoiced are mapped to customers on QuickBooks by the name. Please keep in mind that QuickBooks does not allow multiple customers with the same name, but Invoiced does allow duplicates.

- Open invoices for active customers will be imported into Invoiced. Invoices that are closed or belong to inactive customers will not be imported.

- Modifications to invoices on Invoiced after they are synced will do nothing to the corresponding invoice in QuickBooks.

- Only payments processed through Invoiced are sent to QuickBooks. Offline payments recorded on Invoiced are not synced to QuickBooks. Any payments applied to invoices on QuickBooks are synced to Invoiced.

- Refunds are not currently synced. Any refunds initiated through Invoiced must be reconciled by hand.

## Troubleshooting

When a sync fails you will be able to see the error message in the *Recent Syncs* section in **Settings** &rarr; **Accounting Sync**. Normally the error message will include the invoice # that failed and a detailed reason why it could not be synced. Oftentimes there is a manual action required on your end.

Below we have documented commonly encountered errors and recommended resolutions. If you are still unable to get your books synced then please contact [support@invoiced.com](mailto:support@invoiced.com) for further assistance.

### Sync is not working

Please make sure you are connected to the internet in order to connect to Invoiced.

### Mismatched password

Every time you download a .qwc file please make sure you are using the associated password. Each time you generate a configuration this will generate a fresh password.

### Updating the .qwc file

If you are installing a new .qwc file, please make sure that you clear out the old sync first if you are replacing an existing sync.

### Error Messages

#### Could not start QuickBooks

You will run into this error if QuickBooks is not open, and you are running the sync through the web connector.  The remedy is to give the sync the ability to login automatically into QuickBooks, even when QuickBooks is closed.

In QuickBooks go to **Edit** &rarr; **Preferences** &rarr; **Integrated Applications** and then click **Properties** under the connected integration.  In the properties screen, choose "Allow this application to login automatically."  You will need to do this for the *Invoice Sync* and *Payment Sync*.
