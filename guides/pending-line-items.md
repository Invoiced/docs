# Pending Line Items	

Adding a Pending Line Item to a customer's account allows you to prepare to bill a customer a specific item. When you add a pending line item, there are two processes that can take place:

1. Adding a pending line item and a subscription
2. Adding a pending line item to be billed as an invoice

Adding a pending line item then adding a subscription will bundle the pending line item into the subscription. For example: a startup fee for the subscription, but you only want it to be billed on the first subscription payment. A pending line item would add the one time start up fee to the first subscription charge.

Adding a pending line item to be billed as an invoice allows you to create an upcoming charge, and then bill to the customer when ready. This will create a one off invoice for the customer.

In the example, the user created a pending line item, and then created an invoice. Once the pending line item is ready to be billed, you will select the Bill Now section, and create an invoice to be billed.
