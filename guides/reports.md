# Reports

Invoiced includes robust reporting out of the box to give you insight into your accounts receivable. You can generate up-to-date reports for all things revenue with accuracy down to the cent.

We currently target two file formats with reporting: **PDF** or **CSV** (comma-separated values).

## A/R Overview

The **A/R Overview** report gives you an overview of your Accounts Receivable activity over a time range. The report shows the aggregate amount invoiced, received, still outstanding, and considered bad debt during the time period you selected. The report does not include detail on any of these activities. Instead, you can use one of the reports below to dig into the numbers.
