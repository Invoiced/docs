## Online Payments

Online payments are essential if you want to get paid quicker. They also are key to auto-charging your clients with subscriptions.

You can accept credit/debit card, and ACH payments through [Stripe](https://stripe.com), the payment processor we have partnered with. Our set up process will help you easily sign up for a merchant account. You can also accept [PayPal](https://paypal.com) payments.

*If you need to accept payments through a different payment processor then please get in touch.*


## Refunding Payments

Whenever a payment is made on a invoice generated by a subscription (automatic or manual) or invoice, Invoiced records a payment.

To get a quick glance at all the invoices, subscriptions, and payments a client has, simply go into the client details by clicking on a client name, after you selected *Clients* from the left navigation bar.

Simply click on a payment you want to refund. Once the payment details show up, click on the **Refund** button.
