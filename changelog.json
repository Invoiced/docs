We made this decision because there are many advantages to the client view over sending PDFs, like view tracking, file attachments, commenting, and payments. Another issue we are correcting is before it was possible to send an invoice email without a client view button or a PDF attachment. This is obviously a terrible situation because your client just received a totally useless email. Instead we now automatically append a client view button to your message if one is not already present AND a PDF was not attached.\n\nIf you prefer attaching PDFs instead then we have added an option on each email template to send PDFs instead of a client view button. Previously you had to make this choice for every email you send. Now you only have to make this choice once for each email template in Settings &rarr; <a href='\/settings\/emails'>Emails<\/a> &rarr; {template} &rarr; Customize. You can change the text on the client view buttons here also (if you want something different than \"View Invoice\").\n\nAlso, we believe that gratitude is important.

When a customer goes to your billing portal (yourusername.invoiced.com) they enter their email address to request a sign in link. If it matches one of your customer profiles we will send them a secure sign in link that expires within an hour. Clicking the sign in button will take your client directly to their account where they can see all of their invoices, submit payments, and manage their billing information just like before. We also sign customers in when they are viewing an invoice, but only temporarily.\n\nSecurity has not been sacrificed compared to the old login system because there was already a forgot password process where customers could receive a reset password link by entering their email address.\n\nGoing passwordless should be entirely transparent to your customers. It does not change nor break the existing workflow for paying invoices in any way. We simply no longer ask customers if they want to sign up for an account during the process. If a customer has already signed up for an account they will still be able to sign in with the same email address sans the password.\n\nWe made this change because the previous sign in feature required your customer to remember yet another password, and signing up for an account was unnecessarily cumbersome.

It was a silly limitation that is now gone. Please note that you still cannot change the amount of a plan with active subscribers nor delete it.\n\nYour existing plans have been migrated and should work the same. However, we highly recommend that you verify the details of your plans are still accurate in the Plans section. Please let us know if you find any issues.",

And, as an added bonus the app will calculate the due date for you when you use NET D or Due on Receipt terms.\n\nYou can change the default payment terms in Settings &rarr; <a href='\/settings\/templates'>Templates<\/a> &rarr; Edit &rarr; Default Values.",

Any customized templates are now fully rendered in the client view instead of the stock template.\n\nIf you have any offline payment methods turned on then they have been moved from the invoice client view to the payment screen. Your clients can see how to pay you simply by clicking the Pay Now button from the bottom of the invoice client view.\n\nAnd lastly, a new Disabled Payment Methods setting is available when creating or editing invoices underneath Options.
