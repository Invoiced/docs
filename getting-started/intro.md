## Registering for Invoiced

First, lets start with an account! If you have not done so already, you need to [sign up](https://invoiced.com/signup) for an Invoiced account. We offer a free trial with no credit card or obligations required. During the sign up process we will ask you a few questions about your business to properly configure Invoiced. 

## Invoiced Dashboard

The dashboard is where you can access all of your customer and billing data. Because Invoiced is web based,  the only system requirement is a modern web browser. As a bonus the dashboard is responsive! Which means it can be used on any device, including: desktops, tablets, and smartphones. This means you can run your business from anywhere (with Internet access).
